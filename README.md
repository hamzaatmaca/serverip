It was created using Mongo DB + Node JS + Javascript + Electron Js technologies. 
This application analyzes the users entering your website and reports them to you.

The user first logs into your website. Then the program, user ip information, address server 
city and country are transmitted to the back-end created with Node Js via APIs. 
Then the Desktop application and the web application (Electron JS) again receives the data with the 
fetch api by the back-end 
and transmits it to the admin.
